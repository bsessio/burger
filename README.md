# Burger Time!

## Overview

If you're like me, you want to eat just, so, so many burgers. This web app will allow you to just keep making and eating burgers until ... well, I'm sure there's a more practical limit than 'heat death of the universe', but let's find out!

## Instructions
Install this on your local server, installing the schema and seeds, and initialize the server. Then eat burgers all day!

["WATCHME video!"](https://bsessio.github.io/burger/public/assets/video/WATCHME.mov)

###### (note: the below document was written with the intent for the video above not to be necessary)
###### Navigate yourself to the website found here: [ "Burger Time!"](https://burger-bws.herokuapp.com/)

###### Then, you can either add a burger by ordering a custom one up, or you can devour one of the burgers already available by clicking Eat Me. 

###### This will change the state to Devoured: True from Devoured: False and move it to the other 'table'. You can not un-eat a burger.

###### You can do the ordering and eating a lot, though.

###### Just, like, so much.

###### There is kind-of a limit to how many you can read on the page, but no limit to the amount you can actually eat (just how many you can visibly wait to eat.)

## Package Dependencies

* MySQL is required for handling the database of burgers.
* Express is required for the website routes.
