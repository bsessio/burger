# Burger Time!

## Overview

If you're like me, you want to eat just, so, so many burgers. This web app will allow you to just keep making and eating burgers until ... well, I'm sure there's a more practical limit than 'heat death of the universe', but let's find out!

## Instructions
Navigate yourself to the website found here: [ "Burger Time!"](https://burger-bws.herokuapp.com/)

Then, you can either add a burger by ordering a custom one up, or you can devour one of the burgers already available by clicking Eat Me. 

This will change the state to Devoured: True from Devoured: False and move it to the other 'table'. You can not un-eat a burger.

You can do the ordering and eating a lot, though.

Just, like, so much.

## Package Dependencies

* MySQL is required for handling the database of burgers.
* Express is required for the website routes.
* Express-Handlebars is required for handling express cleanly.
